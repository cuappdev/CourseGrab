# CourseGrab

Need to add a course but there are no empty slots? Instead of constantly checking for an open slot throughout the day, adding undue stress to your busy life, let CourseGrab do it for you! Simply enter the course ID of the course you want to enroll in, and we'll send you a notification email when the course opens up!

## Environment Variables

We recommended to use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net).

To get started, run the following:

```bash
cp envrc.template .envrc
```

## Information
