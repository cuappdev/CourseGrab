A web app built with Flask, Python, HTML, and CSS.

Every Cornell student runs into trouble with the hectic course signup system, adding some very unneeded stress to the semester.

Need to add a course but there are no empty slots? Give us your email address and the five digit courseid of the lecture or discussion you want to join, and we'll email you when the course is open!
